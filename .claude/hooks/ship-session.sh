# SessionEnd hook. Fires once — but capture no longer depends on this
# firing: track-edit.sh already captures transcript growth locally after
# every edit, so a crash or a PR opened mid-session doesn't lose
# reasoning. This does one final local catch-up capture (for whatever
# happened after the last edit), marks the session ended, sweeps ALL
# unsynced edits/chunks across ALL sessions (not just this one) once, and
# spawns the continuous flush daemon if anything's still pending after
# that. Failures here stay silent — the session exits cleanly either way.
